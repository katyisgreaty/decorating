        As you can see, this room looks terrible. The clashing colors confuse the mind and don't let you relax. The single window just did not have enough light coming in, which definitely needed to be changed. It was terrible. It hadn't been updated since 1979, which was not a great year for decorating.As you can see, this room looks terrible. The clashing colors confuse the mind and don't let you relax.

All new furniture helped brighten the place up, as did new curtains and dark red walls for some reason. This room is vastly improved! We added more windows and just made the room bigger, as well.
